We detailed the universal integration steps for any .NET app in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1q4GqFgSFE).

#### Prerequisites to Run the Demos

- [Visual Studio 2022 v17.0+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) with the following workloads:
  - *.NET desktop development*  |  *ASP.NET and web development*  |  *.NET Core cross-platform development*
- Download and run the [Unified Component Installer](https://www.devexpress.com/Products/Try/) or add [NuGet feed URL](https://docs.devexpress.com/GeneralInformation/116042/installation/install-devexpress-controls-using-nuget-packages/obtain-your-nuget-feed-url) to Visual Studio NuGet feeds.
  - *We recommend that you select all products when you run the DevExpress installer. It will register local NuGet package sources and item / project templates required for these tutorials. You can uninstall unnecessary components later.*
  - For the .NET Framework examples, you need to install DevExpress products with the installer.

## Target Audience & Common Usage Scenarios

- XAF developers who create non-XAF .NET apps and want to reuse existingÂ data models andÂ [Security System](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113366/concepts/security-system/security-system-overview)Â settings (users, roles and permissions) stored in an XAF applicationÂ database. Based on experience, XAFÂ customers create custom Web and mobile UI clients withÂ ASP.NET MVC, DevExtreme;Â backend serversÂ with ASP.NET Web API/OData or Console, Windows Service, WCF apps for variousÂ administrative tasks (data modifications, report generation, scheduled workflows).

- Non-XAF developers who create standard line-of-business (LOB) apps with login, logout forms and security related functionality for any .NET UI technologies likeÂ WinForms, WPF, ASP.NET (WebForms, MVC 5, MVC Core, Razor Pages) and .NET server technologies like ASP.NET Web API/OData, WCF, etc.

Typical .NET App Security & Web API Service scenarios include the following:

- CRUD & Authorization (for instance, check user permissions, if Create, Read, Write, Delete operations are allowed for certain business classes and properties) via EF Core & XPO ORM
- Download PDF from report templates and filtered data in databases using service endpoints (aka Reports)
- Log history of data changes in databases using service endpoints (aka Audit Trail)
- Check state of input data with complex validation rules using service endpoints (aka Validation)
- Download BLOB data stored in databases using service endpoints (aka File Attachments)
- Obtain localized captions for classes, members, and custom UI elements stored in databases using service endpoints (aka Localization)
